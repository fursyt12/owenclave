# Adds the owenclave pacman repository and installs the desktop client.
#
# One command (as root, which is why it is meant to be piped into sudo bash):
#
#   sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fursyt12/owenclave/dev/packaging/arch/setup-repo.sh)"
#
# The repository lives in the moving `desktop-repo` release, so the same URL keeps
# working across versions and `pacman -Syu` picks up new builds.
#
# Options:
#   --uninstall        remove the repository entry (the package stays installed)
#   --repo <url>       use a different repository URL
#   --no-install       only touch /etc/pacman.conf
#
# The packages are not GPG signed, hence SigLevel = Optional TrustAll below: the
# repository is fetched over HTTPS from one fixed GitHub release URL.
